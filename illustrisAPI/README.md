tools to make accessing (all) Illustris data simple, using just a laptop and an internet connection


The basic philosophy of these tools is this:
  anyone with a computer, an internet connection, can access (basically) all of the Illustris data quickly and easily.
Obviously the Illustris data is huge, but most users will only want a fraction of it at a time, be it the properties of stars of one galaxy or a bulk property of every galaxy in the simulation (e.g. galactic star formation rate).
This means you can download the data in manageable chunks with a reasonably fast internet connection, and start playing with them straight away.
It builds on the excellent API tools created by the Illustris team (http://www.illustris-project.org/data/) but attempts to translate most tasks you might want to complete into simple commands.

The data structure has similar names and organization to the raw illustris data detailed above (and I'll try and highlight where they differ)
there are numerous simulations
  each has ~136 snapshots (some, e.g. a couple at ~z=1 in Illustris-1 are corrupted and thus left out)
    the data in the snapshots are sorted into individual dark matter halos and subhalos (the latter is roughly synonomous with an individual galaxy)
      each halo/subhalo has some bulk properties, like total stellar mass or mean gas metalicity
        each halo/subhalo contains a whole bunch of particles (gas,DM,stars and BHs + more obscure things) and each particles has simple properties (like position, mass and velocity)

Sometimes you may want to compare just bulk properties of galaxies (e.g. in the example notebook we recreate the M_BH, sigma relation)
Sometimes you may want to look at specific galaxies (e.g. in the example notebook we plot the projected stellar denisty of a galaxy from a few angles)

The code is relatively simple, and I plan to expand further (in what you can do with it more than in complexity), get in touch if there's something you'd like to see/do.
The repository contains a few files, all th routines live in data, an exaple of their use can be found in the apiTestNotebook, your own API key needs to be put in ApiKey.txt (more on that later) and temporary data will start appearing in temp*.hdf5 files as you use it.

There are a few requirements:

Python packages - numpy, h5py and requests (all easy to get via anaconda) + matplotlib for the example notebook
    (I wrote everything in python 3, hopefully it should all work in python 2 but let me know!)

An API key - Anyone can sign up for an account to use the Illustris data here: http://www.illustris-project.org/data/ .
    You'll be given an API key, which lets the system know that it's you trying to access the data
    You need to replace the text in ApiKey.txt with that API key!

Some disk space - Most of the files you'll be using will be nice and small, it's probably possible to pull something of order ~1 GB (e.g. particle data from the largest galaxies in Illustris 1). 
    You can always check the size of the temp*.hdf5 files, and if they're larger than you can handle think of ways you can pull less data.
    E.g. Pull less fields, look at a smaller galaxy with less particles or use one of the smaller box/ lower resolution simulation runs.

An internet connection - I made and tested this package using the free municipal wifi (albeit in Germany), so it doesn't require blisteringly fast internet
    The biggest problem is a patchy connection, it's not uncommon I see an error involving a 'truncated end of file' on worse connections.
    To the best of my understanding this is caused by the connection faltering part way through a big download.
    We're thinking of a better solution, but for now the fixes are to: download smaller data (not ideal), improve your connection (not ideal) or try again (suprisingly effective!)

I'll outline the basic functionality of the commands below:
  get - this is doing the actual pulling from online, you hopefully won't need to touch it
  
  Getting Data - the following commands get a *dictionary* of data about a particular object: Simulations, Snapshots and Halos/Subhalos
    getSimData(simulation='Illustris-1') 
      - very basic info about the simulation, useful stuff involves cosmology parameters and the boxsize
    
    getSnapData(snapshot=135,simulation='Illustris-1')
      - very basic info about a particular snapshot, stuff like the current redhsift and number of groups
